/**
 * The precheck behind issue #157: a file a hotfix swap or restore writes is created by this
 * process, and when this account may not give it back its previous owner, the swap used to leave it
 * owned by this account and still succeed. Invariants: files are grouped by their current owner and
 * one file per owner is probed through {@link FileOps#canRestoreOwner}, so a package of hundreds of
 * files costs one probe per owner; nothing on disk changes; missing files and files whose owner
 * cannot be read are skipped, since there is nothing to restore for them.
