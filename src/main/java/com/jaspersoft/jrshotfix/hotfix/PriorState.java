/**
 * What each file the hotfix touches looked like immediately before the swap, read from the run's
 * own pre-swap snapshot rather than from the plan.
 *
 * <p>The plan hashes its targets when it is built, which is the right moment for the fingerprint
 * that refuses a server that changed underneath it, and the wrong moment for anything the run has
 * to undo. {@code upgrade --reapply-hotfixes} builds the apply plan before the upgrade and runs it
 * after, so between the two the whole webapp is replaced: every plan-time hash then describes files
 * that no longer exist. Recording those as the "before" state leaves {@code hotfix_files} claiming
 * the previous version's bytes, and a later {@code hotfix rollback} restores the snapshot correctly
 * and then reports that every file differs from it.
 *
 * <p>Invariants: the snapshot is the run's own, taken by {@code snapshot} one step before the swap,
 * so it is the state the compensation will restore to and nothing else can be; a path the snapshot
 * does not list did not exist, which is exactly what an absent before-hash means in {@code
 * hotfix_files}; {@link #unknown()} is the one case where nothing can be said, and callers fall
 * back to the plan rather than treat every file as new.
